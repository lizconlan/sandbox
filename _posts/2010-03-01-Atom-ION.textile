The new Atom ION's pretty good - the early ones were a reasonable compromise of size and power over performance, but let's be honest, they were a bit slow. The "Atom ION 330":http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=35641 however is a different animal...

Still low power consumption and cool enough to run fanless but this time it's dual core 64-bit. Very impressive. And the onboard NVIDIA ION graphics on the stock motherboards is perfectly capable of powering a 42" "monitor" at 1080p. Mine's an "Acer Revo 3610":http://support.acer.com/acerpanam/desktop/2009/acer/aspire/AspireR3610/AspireR3610sp2.shtml. Getting it all to work under Windows 7 is a bit of a fiddle - the config I have a the moment is:
